				<h2>Our Journey</h2>
				<p>We take pride in cultivating our home-grown leaves, blending the finest organic teas and ingredients from carefully sourced farms, and hand-crafting ceramics to accompany the flavours. This holistic craft invites a deeper connection with ourselves and with nature. For centuries, tea has been ceremonial and ritual, as it is also personal. Tea has a unique power to heal, transform and soothe. Our teas enhance these experiences by creating space to breathe and find balance in busyness. Whether you are creating that space for peace in solitude or community, tea is a celebration of truly being connected.</p>

			<div class="wrapper-text-2">
				<p>Our farm Teashop offers a selection of high quality non-blended estate grown organic teas, as well as a wide variety of creative tea and tisane blends. The teas we offer for sale are sourced from small scale organic tea farms worldwide. We believe in small scale organic and biodynamic tea farming and use only the finest ingredients in our artisan blends. We blend teasâ€¦ we do not flavour any of our tea recipes, that means no synthetic essences or artificial flavourings. They are all fresh, beautiful and unique. The herbs used in our teas are sourced as close to home as possible, always organically grown.
				The Tearoom and Garden Patio experience features our diverse selection of loose leaf teas and delectable tea infused sweets.</p>
